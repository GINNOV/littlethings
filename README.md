# One man's junk is another man’s treasure

🧘🏼 In this repo there is a little bit of everything across multiple domains of science and technology. Like in a garage sale, you never know until you cruise through and take a chance on something.

🏴‍☠️ I’m a jack-of-all-trades, passionate about various things.

I create stuff for myself, and if I come across something that might I feel it could be useful for someone else that after a long Google search lands here, I share it without any fancy packaging. To bring some joy or just some "why why why Mario!!" 🤙🏼


🙏🏼 I hope, today, that it's you!
